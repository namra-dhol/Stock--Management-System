# Stock Management System - Solution Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive solution implemented to fix the Stock Management System issues. The solution addresses API consumption problems, product list display issues, dropdown population, and adds a complete invoice reporting system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Consumption Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Application failed to properly consume external API, resulting in incomplete data retrieval
- **Solution**: 
  - Refactored `ProductController` to use dependency injection with `IApiService`
  - Updated `ApiService` to properly handle API calls with error handling and logging
  - Registered `ApiService` in `Program.cs` for dependency injection
  - Implemented proper async/await patterns throughout

### 2. Product List View Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Product list view did not display all expected data (missing Product ID, etc.)
- **Solution**:
  - Added Product ID column to the product list table
  - Updated table structure to show all relevant product details
  - Fixed column span for "No Products found" message

### 3. Dropdown Population Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Category dropdown and other dropdowns were empty
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `PopulateDropdowns` method to use `ApiService` instead of direct HTTP calls
  - Implemented proper error handling for dropdown population
  - Added fallback empty lists when API calls fail

### 4. Invoice Report System ✅
- **Problem**: No invoice report controller or view existed
- **Solution**:
  - Created complete `InvoiceReportController` with CRUD operations
  - Added `Invoice` and `Customer` models to the API project
  - Created `InvoiceController` in the API with filtering and summary endpoints
  - Implemented `InvoiceReportViewModel` for proper data binding
  - Created comprehensive views: Index, Details, and Create

### 5. Navigation Updates ✅
- **Problem**: Layout file needed direct links to invoice report and dashboard
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `_Layout.cshtml` with proper navigation structure
  - Added active link highlighting based on current controller
  - Organized navigation into logical sections (Inventory, Transactions, Reports)

## New Features Added

### Invoice Management System
- **Invoice Creation**: Complete form with validation and auto-calculation
- **Invoice Filtering**: Filter by date range, customer, and status
- **Invoice Details**: Detailed view with print functionality
- **Summary Dashboard**: Overview cards showing key metrics

### Enhanced API Integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Logging**: Proper logging throughout the application
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean architecture with proper service registration

## Technical Implementation

### API Controllers Added
- `InvoiceController.cs` - Complete CRUD operations for invoices
- Enhanced `ProductController.cs` - Added dropdown endpoints

### MVC Controllers Updated
- `ProductController.cs` - Refactored to use `ApiService`
- `DashboardController.cs` - Updated to use `ApiService`
- `InvoiceReportController.cs` - New controller for invoice management

### Models Added
- `Invoice.cs` - Invoice entity with relationships
- `Customer.cs` - Customer entity
- `InvoiceReportViewModel.cs` - View model for invoice reports

### Views Created
- `Views/InvoiceReport/Index.cshtml` - Invoice listing with filtering
- `Views/InvoiceReport/Details.cshtml` - Invoice details view
- `Views/InvoiceReport/Create.cshtml` - Invoice creation form

### Database Updates
- Added `Invoice` and `Customer` entities to `StockContext`
- Configured entity relationships and constraints
- Added proper field configurations

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server (or SQL Server Express)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Setup Steps

1. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to StockApi project
   cd StockApi
   
   # Add migration for new entities
   dotnet ef migrations add AddInvoiceAndCustomerEntities
   
   # Update database
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. **Run the API**
   ```bash
   cd StockApi
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API will be available at `https://localhost:7066`

3. **Run the MVC Application**
   ```bash
   cd StockConsume
   dotnet run
   ```
   The MVC application will be available at `https://localhost:5001`

### Configuration
- Update connection strings in `appsettings.json` files
- Ensure API URL in `ApiService.cs` matches your API endpoint
- Configure authentication settings as needed

## API Endpoints

### Product Endpoints
- `GET /api/Product` - Get all products
- `GET /api/Product/{id}` - Get product by ID
- `POST /api/Product` - Create product
- `PUT /api/Product/{id}` - Update product
- `DELETE /api/Product/{id}` - Delete product
- `GET /api/Product/dropdown/categories` - Get categories for dropdown
- `GET /api/Product/dropdown/suppliers` - Get suppliers for dropdown

### Invoice Endpoints
- `GET /api/Invoice` - Get invoices with filtering
- `GET /api/Invoice/{id}` - Get invoice by ID
- `POST /api/Invoice` - Create invoice
- `PUT /api/Invoice/{id}` - Update invoice
- `DELETE /api/Invoice/{id}` - Delete invoice
- `GET /api/Invoice/summary` - Get invoice summary
- `GET /api/Invoice/customers` - Get customers

### Dashboard Endpoints
- `GET /api/Dashboard/summary` - Get dashboard summary
